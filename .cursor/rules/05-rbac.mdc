# RBAC

Roles: `Anonymous`, `User`, `Supervisor`, `Manager`

- Use `RequireRole("User")`, `RequireRole("Supervisor")`, etc. Server validates ownership where required.
- UI hides illegal actions but expects server enforcement.
- Self-assign allowed for Users; assigning others requires Supervisor/Manager.
- Classification endpoint restricted to Supervisor/Manager.
