# Priority

- **Red Flag**: any true ⇒ `P0`.
- **Impact Score** = min(7, Σ impacts with weights: 4/4/4/2/1).
- **Urgency Score** = 3 (≤48h), 2 (3–7d), 1 (8–30d), 0 (≥31d or none).
- **Final Score** = min(10, Impact + Urgency).
- **Priority**: P0 = 9–10 or Red Flag; P1 = 6–8; P2 = 3–5; P3 = 0–2.
- Table-driven tests cover edge cases.
