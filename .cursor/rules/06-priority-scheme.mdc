# Priority - New Negative Scoring System

- **Red Flag**: any true ⇒ `P0`. Each Red Flag = -5 points.
- **Impact Score** = Σ impacts with weights: -5/-5/-5/-3/-2 (LawNonCompliance/SevereSecurity/PaymentAbnormal/LostRevenue/NoWorkaround).
- **Urgency Score** = -5 (≤48h), -3 (3–7d), -2 (8–30d), 0 (≥31d or none).
- **Final Score** = Impact + Urgency + RedFlags + 45 (normalized to 0-45 scale).
- **Maximum Score**: Exactly 0 (all criteria met: -20 impact + -5 urgency + -20 red flags + 45 = 0).
- **Priority Thresholds**: P0 = 0–10 or Red Flag; P1 = 11–20; P2 = 21–35; P3 = 36–45.
- **Lower scores = Higher priority** (inverted scale for intuitive critical scoring).
